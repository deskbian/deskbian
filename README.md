About Deskbian
==============

This project is an **unofficial** Debian Blend-like distribution ([what is a Debian Blend?](http://blends.debian.org/blends/)) aiming at simplyfing the installation process and initial configuration of end-user Debian desktop systems.

The main target audience is inexperienced users who would otherwise have trouble configuring a vanilla Debian system, and would rather turn to friendlier Linux distributions or even to proprietary systems.

**IMPORTANT: DESKBIAN IS IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH THE DEBIAN PROJECT, THIS IS A COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT EFFORT.**

Being a Blend, it is not a fully-fledged Debian fork and the modifications stay minimal, mostly preseeding the installer image and adding a few custom packages for automatic configuration of the system.
